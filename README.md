## npp-darcula

### Dark theme for Notepad++ based on Darcula theme from JetBrains products

####Currently the following languages are fully supported:
* ASM
* C/C++
* C#
* Java
* Python
* PHP
* SQL
* JavaScript and JSON
* HTML, XML
* CSS
* CMake
* Bash
* ChaiScript(through my [language support component](https://github.com/gogo2/npp-chaiscript) )

(Note: some styles may slightly differ from original Darcula because of Notepad++ limitations.
I'm going to take a look into possibilities of tweaking Notepad++ parser, but it's not my highest priority.)

####Installation
Copy file **Darcula.xml** to _C:/Users/{UserName}/AppData/Roaming/Notepad++/themes_ directory.


####Stay tuned for more languages!
